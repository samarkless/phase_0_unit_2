# U2.W4: Cipher Challenge

# I worked on this challenge with:

#Sam / Jake / Tim 

# 1. Solution
# Write your comments on what each thing is doing. 
# If you have difficulty, go into IRB and play with the methods.

def north_korean_cipher(coded_message)
  input = coded_message.downcase.split("") # Check out this method in IRB to see how it works! Also refer to the ruby docs. Downcase method downcases first letter and split separates a string, in this case, with nothing added in between. 
  decoded_sentence = []
  cipher = {"e" => "a",   # This is technically a shift of four letters...Can you think of a way to automate this? The rotate method will automatically shift an object's elements either right or left the given amount. So in this case, a rotate(4) will be effective. 
            "f" => "b",   # Is a hash the best data structure for this problem? What are the pros and cons of hashes? A hash is more effective when a key and value pair are needed, which in this case seems to be true as the cipher is made up of pairs. 
            "g" => "c", 
            "h" => "d", 
            "i" => "e", 
            "j" => "f",
            "k" => "g",
            "l" => "h",
            "m" => "i",     
            "n" => "j",
            "o" => "k",
            "p" => "l",
            "q" => "m",
            "r" => "n",
            "s" => "o",
            "t" => "p",

  input.each do |x| # What is #each doing here? The each method is iterating through the block, in this case, the user input that has been split to each character. 
    found_match = false  # Why would this be assigned to false from the outset? What happens when it's true? The variable is instantiated to false because it's acting as a flag for whether or not a match has been found. On lines 50, 54, and 58 you can see the variable is changed to true, this occurs if the letters match, or it is a symbol or number.
    cipher.each_key do |y| # What is #each_key doing here? Each_key parses through the key values. If the character found matches a key, the loop will append the cypher's answer to the decoded sentence.
      if x == y  # What is this comparing? Where is it getting x? Where is it getting y? What are those variables really? The two variables in the hash, in this case x would be the key and y would be the value. In the case of the method, x is the input by the user and y is the encoded character. 
        puts "I am comparing x and y. X is #{x} and Y is #{y}."
        decoded_sentence << cipher[y]

        found_match = true
        break
      end 
    end

  if decoded_sentence.match(/\d+/) #What is this matching? Look at Rubular for help. \d is any digit and + is one or  more digits, so this is looking for a number in the decoded_sentence
    decoded_sentence.gsub!(/\d+/) { |num| num.to_i / 100 } #He's been known to exaggerate... And this divides it by 100

# Reflection

#What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
# I think for the most part our teamwork negated a lot of the more complex parts of this challenge. Going through
# each part of the code and explaining what each part did really helped when we were refactoring. Sometimes we
# would run into problems when trying to get our refactored code to work but we managed to push through these
# by communicating and researching.

#What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
# We had a few questions about specific parts of the code and how they worked, we would use sites
# such as stackoverflow.com to find examples and answers.

#What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
#Some of the terms and methods used in the code above were quite new to me however my team was there to explain everything
#and this was really useful!

#Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
# how to use the rotate function!

#How confident are you with each of the learning objectives?
# decently confident

#Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
# working as a team and explaining what each part of the code did.

#Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
# None.
